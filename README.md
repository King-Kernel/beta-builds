# beta-builds

These builds are BETA meaning that they are somewhat stable, but they can break your device
if you're not careful

Marlin builds always go through my device first before pushing to the beta repo, so there is
an added benefit of safety there

Bluecross builds don't have this luxury, I'll get a build through testers before publishing here,
so be very careful when downloading from the bluecross branch

All changes are tracked via commits, please read the commit messages to learn more about the build
